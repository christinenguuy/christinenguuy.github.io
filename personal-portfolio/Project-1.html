  <p>This piece is about Ping Pong as it was the very last thing that I texted my sister about. 
    The instructions was to use a phrase that you texted to someone that can be turned into a poem. The reason why I spoke about ping pong or 
    table tennis was because my sister asked me what our friends were doing in Newman Cafe and I replied with ping pong.</p>
