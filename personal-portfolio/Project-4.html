  <h1>Personal Artwork</h1>
  <p>This is my artwork out of class as I enjoy drawing digitally. I have been drawing for the past year and a half or so, 
    which makes me still in the learning realm of art. This piece is of a character from Genshin Impact. I enjoy drawing game characters and anime characters. 
    I would like to branch out of my confort zone of only drawing 3/4 faces and instead draw more body action.</p>
