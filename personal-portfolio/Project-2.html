  <h1>Green Screen</h1>
  <p>This is the Green Screen Project where I make a edit of a video and use that as my background on camera. 
    I used zoom to record and make it into a green screen.This was a fun project to learn because it seems 
    like a cool thing to know how to do. I made my video on Bea Miller and Khalid 
    when I went to their concerts a few years ago.</p>
