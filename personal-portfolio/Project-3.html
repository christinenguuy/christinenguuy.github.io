  <h1>Twine</h1>
  <p>This is a story game project where I made a story game with choices to choose using an app called Twine. 
    A lot of video game developers use this app to create a story of their own. I enjoyed making this piece mainly for the story aspect.
  I was inspired by the League of Legends animated series on Netflix called Arcane.</p>
